          <p>Men might put on contemporary styled kurtas and dhotis, while women often wear silk, chiffon or velvet saris along with cigarette pants or ankle-length skirts called lehngas with matching cholis or bodices, gowns or other traditional attire depending on the culture and faith.Traditionally, Diwali celebrations involved wearing traditional Indian attire such as sarees, salwar suits or lehengas for women and kurta-pajamas or sherwanis for men. These outfits were usually made from rich fabrics like silk or velvet and adorned with intricate embroidery or embellishment.While it's not necessary to wear traditional Indian party wear, incorporating some Indian elements into your attire can add a festive touch and show respect for the occasion. Consider wearing a kurta top paired with trousers or a skirt, or opt for a saree-inspired dress with a draped effect.
